# Welcome to Codeunia's First Contribution Project! ðŸ‘‹

This project is designed to help new members get familiar with the basic Git and GitHub workflow by making a simple contribution. Your goal is to add your name and a small introduction to our community roster!

## How to Make Your First Contribution:

Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Fork this Repository:**
    * Go to the top right of this page and click the "Fork" button. This creates a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    * On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL.
    * Open your terminal or Git Bash.
    * Run: `git clone [YOUR_FORK_URL]` (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/your-username/first-contribution.git`)
    * Navigate into the cloned directory: `cd first-contribution`

3.  **Create a New Branch:**
    * It's good practice to work on a new branch for your changes.
    * Run: `git checkout -b add-your-name` (Replace `your-name` with your actual name, e.g., `git checkout -b add-john-doe`)

4.  **Make Your Changes:**
    * Open the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file (or `README.md` if you decide to put it there) in your favorite text editor.
    * **Add your details to the "Community Roster" section below.** Follow the example format.

5.  **Save and Stage Your Changes:**
    * After saving the file, go back to your terminal.
    * Run: `git add CONTRIBUTORS.md` (or `git add README.md`)

6.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    * Run: `git commit -m "Add [Your Name] to the community roster"` (e.g., `git commit -m "Add John Doe to the community roster"`)

7.  **Push Your Changes:**
    * Run: `git push origin add-your-name` (Use the branch name you created in step 3)

8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Go back to your forked repository on GitHub in your web browser.
    * You should see a "Compare & pull request" button or banner. Click it.
    * Ensure the base repository is `Codeunia/first-contribution` and your branch is selected.
    * Give your PR a clear title (e.g., "feat: Add [Your Name] to roster").
    * Add a brief description if you wish.
    * Click "Create pull request."

That's it! Someone from Codeunia will review your PR and merge it. Congratulations on your first contribution!
